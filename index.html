                <p>
                    I am an individual with a diverse set of interests and a passion for technology.
                    I have a strong background in SAP ABAP and UiPath Automation development, with nearly 2 years of
                    professional experience
                    in these fields.
                    I am not only dedicated to my career but also highly committed to my education,
                    as I am currently on a journey to expand my knowledge in full-stack software development.
                    My eagerness to learn and grow in the ever-evolving tech landscape is truly commendable.
                    In the academic realm, I have explored a wide range of subjects, including web development,
                    Python, programming logic, project management, and database management.
                    This diverse educational background equips me with a solid foundation for my future endeavors.
                    Beyond my academic and professional life, I have embraced new hobbies since moving to Canada,
                    including poetry, reading books, self-learning, cooking, and hiking. My enthusiasm for personal
                    growth extends
                    to my spare time as well. My dedication to my education, career, and personal development shines
                    through in my pursuits
                    and is a testament to my well-rounded nature.
